Here we have created three main files that is cssScript.jsp, validate.js and style.css. 

In "cssScript.jsp" file, the following code imports style.css file from css folder
<link rel="stylesheet" href="../css/style.css" type="text/css"></link>

and the code below imports validate.js file from script folder.

<script language="JavaScript" type="text/JavaScript" src="../script/validate.js"></script>

The style.css file is used to implement the style for the jsp page i.e. look and feel for the page and the validate.js file is used for field validation.
